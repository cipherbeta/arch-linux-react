# Arch Linux Website (React)

This is a small personal project to play around with the [RSS to JSON](https://rss2json.com/) api. I personally run arch linux on my main dev machine at the moment so I figured it'd be a fun personal project to mess around and remake the website with React and RSS feeds. 

Currently still building out the skeleton and such.

## To View

Clone the repository, and run `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies. Run `npm start` to launch the server and view the application. If you want to build it to a static site, run `npm build`. If you want to play around a bit with the SCSS, install `concurrently` either as a dev asset or globally, and run `npm run dev` to launch the server and `node-sass` parallel.
